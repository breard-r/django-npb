- report any remarkable change in the change log;
- document every publicly accessible item (module, function, â€¦) and insert examples;
- write unit tests that checks your code is working well;
- for bug-fixes, write unit tests showing the corrected bug;
- for new features, do not forget to create the C-bindings;
- yes, unit tests have to be written for C-bindings too;
- **launch the test suite before submitting your code**, obviously every single test have to pass.

## Coding style

- Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as possible;
- indent code with 4 spaces;
- no trailing whitespace at the end of lines;
- use descriptive variable names;
- functions should be as short as possible, do only one thing and do it well.

In a more general way, if you feel your code doesn't look like the project's one, fix it.
